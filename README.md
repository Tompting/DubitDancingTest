# DubitDancingTest
For programming interview at Dubit Limited - January 2021

Here you can find all of the source code the my programming interview.
Although the initial commits found in this repository are partially completed, you can see the full implementation of the mobile side of the software through the subsequent commits to see more accurately my update protocols and how I work with existing code.

Please feel free to submit pull requests and improve this software as much as possible, for I am proud of this work and would love to see it implemented.
-Tom Mackintosh :)
